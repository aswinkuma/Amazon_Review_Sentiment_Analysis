## Business Problem:
    To extract  reviews of a product from AMAZON and perform sentiment analysis 

## Objective:
    Most of the people are expressing their view by posting it on social media and e-commerce sites platforms about a product. 
    We need to understand the liking or disliking of that product to help the organization to make some decisions about the production and supply of the same in the market. 
    So here consider extracting reviews from ecommerce websites and analyze them to satisfy the objective.
